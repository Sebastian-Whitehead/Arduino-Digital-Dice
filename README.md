# DIY Digital Dice (d10000)

â€‹	This is an Arduino based DIY digital dice that, as standard, can generate a random number between 0 and 4 /6 /8 /10 /12 /20 /100 /1000 *or* 10000 along with a coin flip between heads and tails (1/2.) Using a gyroscope the device can sense its rotational acceleration around any one of the three axis and generate a random number when a specified threshold is reached. Originally created to use along side with an extended 'chaos magic' in DnD 5e. Despite this the dice can function as a physical random number generator for any situation with little modification to the Arduino code if wanted.
