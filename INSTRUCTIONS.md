# Assembly Instructions

###### Tools

- Soldiering station (*possibly a hot air gun for heat shrink*)

- Screw driver and small wrench for mounting
- 3D printer (*alternatively order the model*)
- PC *with Arduino IDE installed*
- Mini-B USB cable
- Hot Glue Gun, Double Sided Tape & Zip Ties



###### Assembly

1. Order PCB using the included Gerber files 
2. Gather Compatible Electrical components for assembly 
   <u>(butcher a USB battery bank for the charging circuit)</u>
3. Modify the 3D model in order to accommodate you chosen components or as you see fit
4. Print the model components and gather the necessary mounting hardware  
5. If you have the tools to do so test the components before assembly with the 
   '*Digital Dice_ Arduino Program*'
6. Soldier all the components on the Arduino side of the board. 
7. Cut all excess leg length to make space for components on the other side of the board. 
8. Assemble and mount components on the opposite side of the PCB
   **NOTE: Put screws through the displays mounting holes with spacers in-between it and the PCB**
9. Adjust the screen contrast now as it will be difficult later
10. Mount the selection up and down buttons to the front panel and soldier their wires to the corresponding holes on the board
11. If necessary feed the power switch cables through the mounting hole 
    *(only necessary if the toggle switch is screwed in from the inside of the cube)*
12. Soldier the battery to the power switch and the corresponding 5v supply and ground holes on the PCB 
    *(There is 3v3 supply for backlit switches)*
13. Mount the PCB to the included screw holes making sure the black LCD bezel is aligned with the cut out 
14. Mount the power button and charging circuit to their corresponding locations.
15. Mount the LiPo battery cell to and adequate location
16. Charge, Power ON, Test
17.  **ENJOY!!** 



**WARNING!**	Make sure to take precautions when working with LiPo batteries as there are some inherent dangers that can arise. Preform this project at your own risk and if you make improvements or modifications for the project feel free to post them on the GitHub page for others to enjoy.
